# Algorithms Level 1 
There are 50 (easy) problems solved using the Divide and Conquer strategy, integrating most of the techniques I have learned, such as structs, enums, and others.
The repository contains my solutions to all fifty problems. Some solutions may have been copied from the instructor after I had already solved them, in order to better reinforce the concepts.

The code is well-formatted, but there are some differences in how programs are presented. This is a matter of personal preference, since the final solution is ultimately the same.

# Whats new that I learnt
- Broadened my perspective on different solution approaches for some problems involving enums and structs.
