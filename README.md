# Algorithms – Level 1

## Overview
This repository contains 50 easy problems solved using the Divide and Conquer approach.
The goal of this level is to build a strong foundation by integrating most of the techniques learned so far, such as structs, enums, and basic problem decomposition.

The repository includes my solutions to all fifty problems. Some solutions may have been copied from the instructor after solving them independently, in order to reinforce the concepts and compare approaches.

### Notes
- There may be slight differences in how programs are presented, which comes down to personal preference—the core logic and final results remain the same.

## What I Learned in This Level

- Broadened my perspective on different solution approaches for problems involving enums and structs

- Improved my ability to break down simple problems using Divide and Conquer

- Gained more confidence in organizing logic before writing code
